Static Artificial Neural Network Datasets
=========================================

We have a base datasets related to 
`EMBER: An Open Dataset for Training Static PE Malware Machine Learning Models <https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04637v2>`_ 
paper called EMBER. You can find the datasets inside 
`elastic/ember <https://github.com/elastic/ember>`_ repository.

`EMBERSim: A Large-Scale Databank for Boosting Similarity Search in Malware Analysis <https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01835>`_ 
paper from NIPS conference 2023 that provide some enchancement inside 
`CrowdStrike/embersim-databank <https://github.com/CrowdStrike/embersim-databank>`_ 
repository.

Although these datasets are perfect for any model, they are outdated and here 
comes our datasets which you can find inside ` <>`_.

You can find our ANN 

.. note:: We use the EMBER dataset to train our base models and then we use our datasets to fine-tune the models.
